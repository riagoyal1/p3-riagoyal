## Spotify Recap

This project allows users to see their top tracks, similar to the Spotify Wrapped, but with the ability to change the time frame from which the affinities are calculated from. It allows users to select from 3 different time periods: short term, medium term, and long term. 

## How do I get the key for the Spotify Web API?

In order to get the Client ID and Client Secret necessary to use this app, you can navigate to https://developer.spotify.com/ and log in using your Spotify details. Go to 'Dashboard', then 'Create An App' or 'My New App". After creating the app you'll see Client ID and Client Secret underneath the app name. Add these credentials to the secret.code.py file in order to run your code.
